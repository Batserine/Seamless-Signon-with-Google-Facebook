# Seamless-Signon-with-Google-Facebook
This system contains single tap authentication through social plugins.
I basically retrieve profile information from authenticated users and post it on the web-application.

Tools Used:
To build this system I used web-storm it generates a localhost by itself.

References:
Google developers
Facebook developers

Requirements:
  -First of all you need to create a localhost since I used webstorm it is not necessary
  -Then for Google go to developers site and create a api key and oauth client id for which you need to provide your website/localhost.
  -Similarly for facebook go to developers site, then you need to insert your app and get an Appid from it and provide your website/localhost you are using.
Insert all these details in the client -id and Appid part of the code and try it.
